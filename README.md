# CSC8008---SQL-Databases
The practical assessment for CSC8008. The goal of the assignment was to design a relational database in an entity-relationship diagram and then implement this in SQL. The scenario was creating databases to store information needed to organise a music festival (such as storing information about bands playing and venues to be used) and then construct queries over the resulting database implementation. The aim of this project was to demonstrate the knowledge of creating and implementing databases using SQL.


Problem Statement:

1)	Draw an entity-relationship diagram for the above scenario. You must explain any assumptions that you make during the design process. (20 marks).

2)	Implement your design in MySQL. Populate your database tables with data of your choice. However, you should ensure there is a venue with the name ‘Civic Centre’ to enable you to answer part 3c below. If you make any changes to your original design from Task 1, these must be explained. NB: Remember to include the SQL statements you used to create your tables in your answer document. If you do not do this you will not gain the marks for this section (10 marks).

3)	Construct SQL queries for the following (16 marks). In ALL cases, include screenshots showing the results of your queries – instructions on how to do this are given at the end of this document.

a.	List the name and seating capacity of all venues starting with the largest.
b.	List the names of all customers booked to see concert number 2. 
c.	List the number of artists represented by each booking agent.
d.	List the names of all artists who appear in a concert at the Civic Centre. 

4)	Explain how you could find out how many tickets for concert 1 remain unsold. Give the SQL for any queries you would need to execute (4 marks).
